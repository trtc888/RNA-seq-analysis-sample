# A quick guide to RNA seq analysis
During my work, I often noticed that researchers with limited expousure to bioinformatics studies can be easily overwholmed by the complex results. Imagine seeing 500 genes upregulated, 600 genes downregulated, and tens, if not hundreds pathway involved, the first question usually is, how can that help.

In this quick guide, I will try to make a simple workflow for those who are not very familiar with RNA seq to be hands on. My hope is simply following this guide with minimal modification of the code, we can perform basic but surfficient RNA seq analysis.
My current plan is to write five short documents with given codes, including:
### 0. Configuration of computer
### [1. Data preprocessing of breast cancer RNA req raw results](./1_Preprocess/preprocess.md)
### [2. Quantitative comparison of metaplastic breast cancer and duct breast cancer transcriptomics from TCGA](./2_TCGA_Breast_Cancer/TCGA_Breast_Cancer.md)
### 3. Visualization of quantitative analysis
### [4. Gene ontology analysis and KEGG analysis](./4_GO_KEGG_Reactome/4_GO_KEGG_Reactome.md)
